# gowebserver
Repo just for test golang in webserver development with mongodb + kafka
May be later add docker here

To launch you need to clone this repo in subdirectory of your $GOPATH/src, run 
$ dep ensure
$ go run main.go

May be deploy is not right and you'll must to add some packages via go get -u (so i'll add this later)
